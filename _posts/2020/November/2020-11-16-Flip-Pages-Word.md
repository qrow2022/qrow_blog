Works confirmed with Office 2016/19/365

Every once in a while, I need to make a document that has a page in the middle that's in landscape mode instead of portrait. It usually to have more room for tables and graphs. It's not imediatly apparent how to do this, but it can be done within Word.

1) On the page you want to flip position your cusor at the point of the first character on the page.

2) Select <b>Layout</b> in the Ribbon bar, and then <b>Breaks</b> > <b>Next Page</b>. This seperates your pages into sections where different settings can be applied.

3) Then go ahead and change the orientation.

4) Add a new page (I use the <b>Page Break</b> function on the <b>Insert</b> tab under the <b>Pages</b> option).
