title: Additional GPO policy extensions

Group policy is one of my favorite administration and "security" tools. There are just thousands of possibilities with GPO, and my favorite part is the expandability. If you know the registry settings for either a windows feature/function or an app you can change how it behaves by writing your own GPO file.

I've yet to actually write my own files though, so maybe another post sometime. For now, here is a list of some GPO additions that I have found over the years that are FREE to add to your GPO repertoire.
