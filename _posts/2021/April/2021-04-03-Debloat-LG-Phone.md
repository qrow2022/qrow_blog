title: Debloating LG Android Devices

Back in Agust of 2020, I wrote a post about debloating a new Samsung device for a family member.

Well, I had another family member recently update their phone. This time due to issues with the screen and battery. Once again, debloat to the rescue.

They bought an LG phone which to my surprise didn't have as much bloatware as a Samsung. But, part of that is they are a more technical person and I asked them what apps they wanted to remove. The previous family member is not very technical at all, so I made the decisions for them.

Now rumor has it that LG is going to get out of the phone game soon so I have no official comment on whether or not LG phones are better than Samsung. My personal preference is still either Samsung or Pixels.
