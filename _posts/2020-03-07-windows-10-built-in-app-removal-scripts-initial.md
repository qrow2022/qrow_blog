I built a set of scripts a while back for removing the built in windows 10 apps. Stuff that a normal person might want, but as an IT pro and Cybersecurity person, I don't want. 

These scripts were built back around the 1809 release timeframe and I haven't updated them. But by doing this blog post, I hope to inspire myself to update them. 

I have a small list of to-dos with the update and hope to fix them soon. No guarantes with how they perform on the current versions and upcoming versions of Windows 10 (1909 and 2004).

The scripts are on my github, at the link below:
